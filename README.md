# gamedb
Just a JSON file for game accessibility options. Maybe someone will use it to make something interesting or maybe I'll make a minimal HTML page to display it one day.

I'm tired of buying games only to learn I can't invert the camera controls to my liking and wasting my money, so if this ever saves anyone a few bucks then the effort to document it was worth it.
